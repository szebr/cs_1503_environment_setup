    "I've been interested in machine learning and working on it professionally for many years. I can't *fully* explain why -- but I just personally find the idea really fascinating. I believe in the possibility of a **technological singularity**; I would even say I think it's inevitable, to some extent, and I would like to be a part of that in some small way. Understanding how it works has always been really interesting to me, and taking <ins>Intro to Machine Learning with Patrick Skeba</ins> last semester really cemented my interest.\n",

    "For this course, I'd like to:\n",
    "- Reinforce the knowledge I gained last semester and double down on the fundamentals,\n",
    "- Fill in any gaps in the mathematical underpinnings behind machine learning algorithms that I've already learned about,\n",
    "- Explore new algorithms in a practical context that help me use machine learning in my own projects in a more meaningful way."
